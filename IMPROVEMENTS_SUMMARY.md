# ML Studio Improvements Summary

## ✅ 1. Fixed Training Error

### Problem Fixed:
- **ValueError: Unknown label type: continuous** - Fixed the mismatch between task type detection and model selection

### Solutions Implemented:
- Added `detect_task_type()` function to automatically detect classification vs regression
- Enhanced target variable validation and encoding
- Added task type consistency checks during training
- Proper handling of continuous vs categorical target variables

## 📊 2. Enhanced Evaluation Metrics and Visualizations

### Classification Metrics Added:
- ✅ `accuracy_score`
- ✅ `f1_score` (weighted average for multiclass)
- ✅ `precision_score` and `recall_score`
- ✅ `roc_auc_score` with proper label binarization for multiclass
- ✅ `classification_report` with detailed per-class metrics
- ✅ Enhanced confusion matrix (both normalized and standard)
- ✅ ROC curves for binary and multiclass classification
- ✅ Multiclass ROC curves using One-vs-Rest approach

### Regression Metrics Added:
- ✅ `mean_squared_error`
- ✅ `mean_absolute_error` 
- ✅ `r2_score`
- ✅ `RMSE` (Root Mean Squared Error)
- ✅ Enhanced prediction analysis with statistics
- ✅ Residual analysis (vs predicted and vs actual)
- ✅ Error distribution visualization
- ✅ Q-Q plot for residual normality testing
