**F1-Score**: Balance of precision and recall
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- Higher is better
- Good for imbalanced datasets

**Precision**: Of positive predictions, how many were correct?
- Important when false positives are costly

**Recall**: Of actual positives, how many did we find?
- Important when false negatives are costly

#### **For Regression Problems**

**R² Score**: How much variance is explained by the model
- 1.0 = Perfect fit
- 0.8+ = Good
- 0.6-0.8 = Moderate
- <0.6 = Poor

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared errors
